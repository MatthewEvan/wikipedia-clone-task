                    The franchise originated as a pair of role-playing games developed by Game Freak, from an original
                    concept by its founder, Satoshi Tajiri. Released on the Game Boy on February 27, 1996, the games
                    became sleeper hits and were followed by manga series,
                    a trading card game, and anime series and films. From 1998 to 2000, <i>Pokémon</i> was exported to
                    the rest of the world, creating an unprecedented global phenomenon dubbed "Pokémania". By 2002, the
                    craze had ended, after which <i>Pokémon</i> became a fixture in
                    popular culture, with new products being released to this day. In the summer of 2016, the franchise
                    spawned a second craze with the release of <i>Pokémon Go</i>, an augmented reality game developed by
                    Niantic. Pokémon has since been estimated to be the
                    world's highest-grossing media franchise and one of the best-selling video game franchises.

                    <i>Pokémon</i> has an uncommon ownership structure.<sup>[11]</sup> Unlike most IPs, which are owned
                    by one company, <i>Pokémon</i> is jointly owned by three: Nintendo, Game Freak, and Creatures.[1]
                    Game Freak develops the core series role-playing games, which are published by
                    Nintendo exclusively for their consoles, while Creatures manages the trading card game and related
                    merchandise, occasionally developing spin-off titles. The three companies established The Pokémon
                    Company (TPC) in 1998 to manage the <i>Pokémon</i> property within
                    Asia. The <i>Pokémon</i> anime series and films are co-owned by Shogakukan. Since 2009, The Pokémon
                    Company International (TPCi), a subsidiary of TPC, has managed the franchise in all regions outside
                    of Asia.<sup>[12][13]</sup>

                    The Pokémon franchise is set in a world in which humans coexist with creatures known as Pokémon.
                    <i>Pokémon Red and Blue</i> contain 151 Pokémon species, with new ones being added in subsequent
                    games; as of January 2024,
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon">1,025 Pokémon species</a> have been
                    introduced.<sup>[c]</sup> Most Pokémon are inspired by real-world animals or mythical creatures
                    based on real-life folklore.<sup>[17]</sup> For example,
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pikachu">Pikachu</a> are a yellow mouse-like
                    species<sup>[18]</sup> with lightning bolt-shaped tails<sup>[19]</sup> that possess electrical
                    abilities.<sup>[20]</sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player_character">player character</a> takes the role of
                    a Pokémon Trainer. The Trainer has three primary goals: travel and explore the Pokémon world;
                    discover and catch each Pokémon species in order to complete their
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9dex">Pokédex</a>; and train a team of up to six
                    Pokémon at a time and have them engage in battles. Most Pokémon can be caught with spherical devices
                    known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9_Ball">Poké Balls</a>.
                    Once the opposing Pokémon is sufficiently weakened, the Trainer throws the Poké Ball against the
                    Pokémon, which is then transformed into a form of energy and transported into the device. Once the
                    catch is successful, the Pokémon is tamed and is under the Trainer's command from then on.
                    If the Poké Ball is thrown again, the Pokémon re-materializes into its original state. The Trainer's
                    Pokémon can engage in battles against opposing Pokémon, including those in the wild or owned by
                    other Trainers. Because the franchise is aimed at children,
                    these battles are never presented as overtly violent and contain no blood or gore.<sup>[II]</sup>
                    Pokémon never die in battle - they <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syncope_(medicine)">faint</a> upon being defeated, and can
                    then be rejuvenated at a Poké Center.<sup>[III]</sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                    When a Pokémon wins a battle, it gains <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experience_point">experience points</a>.<sup>[29]</sup>
                    After gaining a certain amount of it, the Pokémon levels up, and its statistics rise. As its level
                    increases,
                    the Pokémon learns new offensive and defensive moves to use in battle. <sup>[30][31]</sup>
                    Furthermore, many species can undergo a form of spontaneous metamorphosis called <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_evolution">Pokémon evolution</a>,
                    and transform into stronger forms.<sup>[32]</sup> Most Pokémon will evolve at a certain level, while
                    others evolve through different means, such as exposure to a certain item.<sup>[33]</sup>
