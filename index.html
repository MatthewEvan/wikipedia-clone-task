            The franchise originated as a pair of role-playing games developed by Game Freak, from an original concept by its founder, Satoshi Tajiri. Released on the Game Boy on February 27, 1996, the games became sleeper hits and were followed by manga series, 
            a trading card game, and anime series and films. From 1998 to 2000, <i>Pokémon</i> was exported to the rest of the world, creating an unprecedented global phenomenon dubbed "Pokémania". By 2002, the craze had ended, after which <i>Pokémon</i> became a fixture in 
            popular culture, with new products being released to this day. In the summer of 2016, the franchise spawned a second craze with the release of <i>Pokémon Go</i>, an augmented reality game developed by Niantic. Pokémon has since been estimated to be the 
            world's highest-grossing media franchise and one of the best-selling video game franchises.

            <i>Pokémon</i> has an uncommon ownership structure.<sup>[11]</sup> Unlike most IPs, which are owned by one company, <i>Pokémon</i> is jointly owned by three: Nintendo, Game Freak, and Creatures.[1] Game Freak develops the core series role-playing games, which are published by 
            Nintendo exclusively for their consoles, while Creatures manages the trading card game and related merchandise, occasionally developing spin-off titles. The three companies established The Pokémon Company (TPC) in 1998 to manage the <i>Pokémon</i> property within 
            Asia. The <i>Pokémon</i> anime series and films are co-owned by Shogakukan. Since 2009, The Pokémon Company International (TPCi), a subsidiary of TPC, has managed the franchise in all regions outside of Asia.<sup>[12][13]</sup>
